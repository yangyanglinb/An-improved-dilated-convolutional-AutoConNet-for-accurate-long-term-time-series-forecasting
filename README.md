# Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Long-term Forecasting

This is an official repository for the paper, titled [Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Long-term Forecasting](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nBCuRzjqK7), accepted at ICLR'24.

Our repo includes Autocorrelation-based Contrastive Loss (AutoCon) and Model Architecture (AutoConNet).

Our code is implemented based on [TSLib](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library), and it also includes some time series models. If you want to evaluate more models, please check the TSLib. We sincerely thank the creators of TSLib for their contributions to the time series community.

## Environment setup
```
python == 3.8
torch == 1.7.1

```

## Run with Scripts
sh ./scripts/AutoCon_{ETTh1|ETTh2|ETTm1|ETTm2|Electricity|Traffic|Weather|Excange|Illness} {CUDA_VISBLE_DEVICES} {# OF RUNS}

Examples
```

$sh ./scripts/AutoCon_ETTh2.sh 0 5 
$sh ./scripts/AutoCon_Traffic.sh 0 5
```

## Reproducibility
For reproducibility, we provide [logs](https://github.com/junwoopark92/Self-Supervised-Contrastive-Forecsating/tree/main/reproducibility/Table1-Extended-long-term-forecasting) of the experimental results in the paper. These logs are generated from the evaluation of the same model five times. We observed performance variations based on GPU devices due to CUDA optimization for CNN layers even though a fixed seed. Our experiments were primarily conducted on the RTX3090.
